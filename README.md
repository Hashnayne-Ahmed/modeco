# **MoDECO** ‚Äî **Mo**tor **D**riven **E**nergy **C**onsumption and **O**ptimization

**MoDECO** - **Mo**tor **D**riven **E**nergy **C**onsumption and **O**ptimization is an open-source tool developed to forecast and optimize energy consumption in motor-driven systems based on a combined theoretical and data-driven framework.

<p align="justify">
The theoretical foundation of MoDECO relies on physics-based formulations that describe motor energy behavior under variable frequency drive (VFD) control, soft starter (SS) operation, and baseline constant-speed scenarios. Key electrical parameters‚Äîsuch as dip depth (Œµ), rated power factor (cos(œÜ·µ£)), and torque deviation (Œ¥)‚Äîare used to quantify normalized energy consumption under different operational modes.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To enable real-time and user-friendly predictions, MoDECO integrates these physics-derived relations into a lightweight forecasting model built using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The trained model accurately maps observable electrical inputs to four normalized energy ratios, allowing facility managers, engineers, and energy analysts to estimate energy savings without requiring detailed speed profile measurements or extensive physical simulations.

## üöÄ Interactive Web Application

Access the live interactive MoDECO app here:

üëâ [Launch MoDECO Web App](https://modeco-o8dt5odosc9lxzyecclwpu.streamlit.app/)

The app allows users to:
- Input basic motor electrical parameters.
- Estimate energy savings for different operational scenarios (VFD only, VFD + SS, SS only).
- Compare results for different motor speed profiles (sinusoidal and hyperbolic tangent).
